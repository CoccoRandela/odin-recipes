    <h4>WHAT YOU DO</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by roasting the chicken on medium heat in some olive oil, skin-side down first. In a separate pot, bring the stock to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the chicken is cooking, finely chop the garlic, the anchovies, the capers and the olives.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you have reached a good browning on both sides of the chicken, remove it from the pan and set it aside, while you roast your finely chopped mixture. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Deglaze with the white wine, let the alcohol evaporate and then add the tomato puree, cook it for 2-3 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the chicken along with enough chicken stock to cover it completely, lower the heat and bring everything to a gentle simmer. Close the lid and let it cook for at least 1 hour, but if you can, leave it for more (<strong>the longer the better!</strong>).
            </li>
            <li>
                Half way through the cooking add your spices.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the time has passed, remove the lid, raise the heat and let the eccess liquid evaporate until you will be left with a thick sauce covering your beautiful chicken legs! adjust for salt and pepper and enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
