This is my first attempt at creating a website.
The idea is to put into practice everything I've learned in the HTML section.
When I am done with this project:
- I will be comfortable writing and arranging plain text in HTML
- I will be able to create ordered and unordered lists
- I will be able to link to pages and images on my website through the use of the appropriate tags and attributes
Let's see!
