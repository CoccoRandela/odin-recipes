    <h1>COCCO'S RECIPES</h1>
        <p>
            After more than ten years cooking at home for my family and friends, I have decided to share with the world my <strong>favorite  recipes</strong>! These vary from my go-tos for a quick and delicious dinner, to gargantuan feasts to leave my guests in awe, but they all share a key feature: I have been perfecting them for a <em>looong</em> time and went through trial and error so that you dont have to!
        </p>

        <p>
            Ok, with that out of the way, here are my recipes, <strong>enjoy</strong>!
